# Booleans-Comparisons-Conditionals

Week 1 - Booleans, Comparisons, and Conditionals

### Basic Requirments

1.Type the two boolean values -- true and false -- into your console.

2.Use the console to accomplish the following:

```
 Write an expression using > that will evaluate to false 
 Write an expression using > that will evaluate to true 
 Write an expression using < that will evaluate to false 
 Write an expression using < that will evaluate to true 
 Write an expression using two numbers and === that will evaluate to true 
 Write an expression using two numbers and === that will evaluate to false 
 Write an expression using two strings and === that will evaluate to true 
 Write an expression using two strings and === that will evaluate to false
```

3.Fill in the ??? with the following operators or values to make the statements output the expected Boolean value.

```
 12 ??? 78 
 // => true 
 24 ??? 16 
 // => false 
 45 !== ??? 
 // => true 
 '45' ??? 45 
 // => false '6' ??? 'six' 
 // => true
```

4.In the USA, you can learn to drive when you are 16. Write a function oldEnoughToDrive that takes an age as an argument and returns true if the person with that age is old enough to drive.

5.There is an easy way to figure out how long a string is by adding .length to the end of it. Try this out in the console:

```
 'hello'.length; 
 ''.length; 
 'Yasser al-Azma'.length;
```

6.Write a function sameLength that accepts two strings as arguments, and returns true if those strings have the same length, and false otherwise.

7.Write a function passwordLongEnough that accepts a 'password' as a parameter and returns true if that password is long enough -- you get to decide what constitutes long enough.

8.Write a function rentalCar that accepts a person's name and age as arguments, and returns either 'You cannot have the keys, .', or 'Have fun driving, !' depending on whether or not the person is old enough. In the US, most rental car companies do not allow you to rent a car until you are 21.

9.Write a function max that takes two numbers as arguments, and returns the larger one.

10.Write a function min that takes two numbers as arguments, and returns the smaller one.

11.Write functions larger and smaller that each accept two strings as arguments, and return the larger and smaller strings, respectively

### More Practice

1.Fill in the ??? with the following operators or values to make the statements output the expected Boolean value!

```
 106 ??? 12 
 // => false 
 'wiz' ??? 'wiz' 
 // => true 
 7 * 7  ??? 49 
 // => true 
 12 ??? (24 / 2) 
 // => false 
 (20 % 2) <= ??? 
 // => true 
 (9 / 3) + (5 * 5) === ??? 
 // => true
```

2.Write the functions described below. Each must take one number as an argument:

```
 even: returns true if its argument is even, and false if odd. 
 odd: the opposite of the above. 
 positive: returns true if its argument is positive, and false if negative. 
 negative: the opposite of the above.
```

3.A few other useful built-in mathematical functions are Math.random, Math.floor and Math.ceil. Look at these functions on MDN to learn how they work, and use them to implement the following functions:

```
 randInt: Should accept one numeric argument (n), and return a number from 0 to n - 1. 
 guessMyNumber: Should accept a single numeric argument and compare it to a random number between 0 and 5. It should return one of the following strings: 
       'You guessed my number!' if the argument matches the random number. 
       'Nope! That wasn't it!' if the argument did not match the random number.

```
